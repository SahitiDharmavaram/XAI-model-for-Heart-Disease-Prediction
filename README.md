The domain of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) holds sizeable significance within the healthcare sector, particularly in aiding medical professionals to precisely determine the underlying parameters responsible for certain conditions and evaluate their influence. The purpose of our research is to develop a predictive model, found by experimental comparison of several models- to find the best model, for heart disease. This innovative model collaborates with input provided by doctors and generates explanations explaining the complex factors contributing to the prediction. The model meticulously examines the input data, demonstrating how different factors interact in an explanatory way and how they affect predicting heart disease. The explanations offer both positive and negative correlations, providing a holistic view of the diagnostic process. By providing clinicians with transparent and understandable insights, our model bridges the gap between complex predictive algorithms and human understanding. This interface assists medical practitioners in making informed decisions, leveraging the combined effect of their clinical knowledge with the AI's analytical ability. This integrative approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and gives rise to a deep sense of confidence and trust in the AI's recommendations, thereby aiding a stronger collaboration between medical expertise and technological assistance. This study, hence, presents a paradigm shift in healthcare. Our heart disease prediction model demonstrates XAI's potential to provide valuable insights and a strengthened collaboration between medical professionals and AI systems as well as the overall quality of patient care through informed and calculated decision-making.
